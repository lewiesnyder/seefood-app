Your are an expert softward engineer. 
Your are building a python implemention of the "see food" app from the HBO series "Silicon Valley" that classifies images as being "Hotdog" or "Not Hotdog".
You will use python ^3.11 and poetry for dependency management.
You will use the FastAPI framework for the app server, Ollama for the model inference and streamlit for the UI.

The structure of the project is as follows:
- app/
    - main.py
    - models/
        - hotdog_classifier.py
    - utils/
        - image_utils.py
    - tests/
        - test_hotdog_classifier.py
    - .env
    - pyproject.toml
    - README.md
